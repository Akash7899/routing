                                each day. One of
                                the biggest reasons behind these statistics may be that Indian consumers take bikes with
                                mileage as a
                                utilitarian vehicle rather than a social status.</p>

                        <p> Bikes in India are

                        <p>We all are aware of how India is one of the most massive markets for two-wheelers, with over
                                30 million
                                scooters and bikes on the road. Currently, in India, over 48000 two-wheelers are sold
                                each day. One of
                                the biggest reasons behind these statistics may be that Indian consumers take bikes with
                                mileage as a
                                utilitarian vehicle rather than a social status.</p>
